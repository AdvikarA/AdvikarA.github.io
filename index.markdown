          Hi, I’m Advikar, a high schooler from Massachusetts. I like pens, rocks, stars, and deer (among other things). I wanted to try making a personal website to hold some info and projects I’ve accumulated over the past few years. A lot of the things I’m working on are mostly comp sci focused, but I’m involved in a ton of other random stuff. If you want to contact me, I got socials somewhere below.
