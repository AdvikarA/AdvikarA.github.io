This project was done through Harvard's Undergraduate Quantum Computing Association x qBraid Research Mentorship Program (qRaMP). 

Focused on solving the Maximum Cut Problem -- MaxCut problem is an NP-complete (nondeterministic polynomial-time complete). It is a standard optimization problem that reaps the benefits of quantum computing superposition.

Our solution uses adaptive measurement. This can be seen as making partial measurements on some of the wires and choosing the next gates adaptively

The existing QAOA fails to effectively utilize classical computation, as the classical optimization loop is insensitive to the type of problem the algorithm is solving. We hypothesize that a deliberate classical intervention in QAOA can improve the performance and the convergence speed of the algorithm.
