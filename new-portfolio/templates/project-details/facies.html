<h2>Geographic Facies Predictor</h2>
<p>A web application that uses machine learning to predict geological facies from well log data.</p>
<p>Created a Streamlit app that allows users to upload well log data and visualize the predicted facies.</p>
<p>The application is hosted on Streamlit Cloud and can be accessed through a web browser.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit, Data Visualization, Geoscience</p>
